                         ==========================
1)to_char():-it is used to convert oracle date type into character type.


EX:-

TO_CHAR(
--------
25/08/25

3.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month
  DECEMBER from emp table by using to_char() month format? 


NOTE:-Whenever we are using to_char() MONTH format oracle server 
      internally allocates maximum 9 bytes for MONTH field.
whenever passed MONTH having less number of bytes then oracle server
does not return any rows.To overcome this problem then we must use
fm(fill mode).
