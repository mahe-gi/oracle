                          Functions Task
                         =================
 *
***Dual :- Dual is an oracle predefined virtual table which contains only
 *         one row and one column. Dual table is used to test oracle
           predefined, user defined functions functionality.


     when ever we are installing oracle server then automatically
dual table is created with in SYS user but we are allowed to use dual
table in all other users in oracle database.



 *
***Note:- in oracle by default datatype of the dual table column
 * =====     is varchar2.
 
SQL> select * from dual;

     D    ------->dummy column
   -----
     X

SQL>desc dual;

 Name                Type
-------          ------------
 DUMMY            VARCHAR2(1)



Testing predefined functions functionality:-
==========================================
EX:-
==
sql>select nvl(null,40) from dual;
   
             40

sql>select nvl(20,30) from dual;

             20

     by using dual table we can also perform mathematical
operations.
 

Eg:-
===
SQL> select 100+200 from dual; //one value as result &
                                 work with non table data.

• When we want to get one value as result and we want to work with 
  non table values then use dual.

 *
***Substr():- It will extract portion of the string within given
 * ========        string based on last two parameters.


Syntax:-
========
substr(columnname ,    substring position,   no of characters from position);
          (or)           |->where to start          |->how many characters
      string name                                      from that position onwards
                                          


Starting position-> can be +ve or –ve
Starting position and no of characters position-> must be numbers

17.Select SUBSTR('NARESH IT,HYDERABAD',1,9) from dual;

Answer:-



18.Check the following lpad() and rpad() queries output

SQL>select lpad('kiran',10,'#") from dual;


SQL>select lpad('gowtham',10,'$@') from dual;


SQL>select lpad('X',4,'X') from dual;

•The total length specified is 4  

•The original string length is 1 (because 'X' is a single character)

•Total length-string length = 4-1
                            =  3 
  
•3 X's will be printed on left side of the 
 given string. 

•Since the original string is already 'X', after padding with 3 'X's on the left,
 the output becomes 'XXXX'

output:-
=======
XXXX



SQL>select rpad('ABCD',10,'#')from dual;


SQL>select rpad('kiran',10)||'hello' from dual;


SQL>select rpad(ename,20)||sal from emp;
