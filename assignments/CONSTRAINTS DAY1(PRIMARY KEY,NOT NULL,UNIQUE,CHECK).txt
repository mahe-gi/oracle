                    CONSTRAINTS   TRIGGERS    

     Constraints are used to prevents or stops invalid data
entry into our tables. Generally constraints are created on
table columns.

 Oracle having following types of constraints.
These are

1. Not null
2. Unique
3. Primary key
4. Foreign key
5. Check
6. Default
  
   in database if we want to maintain proper data or valid data 
according to client requirement then we are using SQL language
constraints, Procedure language triggers.


1)NOT NULL:- Not null constraint doesn't support table level.
==========   This constraint doesn't accepts null values. 
             But it will accepts duplicate values.


2.UNIQUE:-This constraint is created on column level, table level.
========  This constraint doesn't accepts duplicate values. But 
          it will accepts null values.


3.Primary Key:- Primary key is Uniquely identifying a record in a 
=============   table. There can be only one primary key in a table. 
                primary key doesn't accepts duplicate, null values. 




4.CHECK:-Check constraint is used to define logical conditions
=======  according to client business rules.
