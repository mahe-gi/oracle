•Relational operators are also called as comparison operators.

•Relational operators are used in where clause only.

column aliasname: It is used to change column heading in final output.
=================

•To give column aliasname we use AS keyword.(Using AS is optional) 
 

•To give column aliasname as multiple words,use double quotes (").

EG:-
===
 sal*12 as "ann sal"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.LOGICAL OPERATORS
===================
 if you want to specify more than one condition in where clause then we are
using either AND or by using logical operator OR.

AND:-AND operator displays the record if both first condition and 
====  second condition are true.

syntax:-select * from tablename
======  where condition1 and condition2;

OR:-OR operator is used to displays a record if either first 
=== condition or second condition is true.

syntax:-select * from tablename
======   where condition1 or condition2;
