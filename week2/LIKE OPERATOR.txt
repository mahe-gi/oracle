Mixed Query:-
===========

NOTE:-Where clause is used to filters the records in a table. And there
===== can be only one WHERE clause in every relational databases. if we
      want filter the data after where then we must use AND operator. 


1.Write a query to display employees who are working as either 'MANAGER' or 'CLERK'

                   Concatenation Operator(|| double pipe):
                   --------------------------------------   

 in relational databases if we want to display strings along with column data
then we must use concatenation operator.

    it is not a special operator rarely used in SQL and regularly
used in PL/SQL. 

Ex:-
===
sql>select 'GOWTHAM'||'RAJ' from dual;

'GOWTHAM'|
----------
GOWTHAMRAJ

1.Write a query to display the empno and a concatenated string showing the

   7499 ALLEN  earns  1600
   .
   .
   7902 FORD   earns  3000
   7934 MILLER earns  1300

2.display the output as following from emp table by using 
  concatenation operator
