                            DDL TASK
                          ===========

-----> SNO 

-----> SNAME

-----> GENDER

2.What is the command to view the structure of the STUDENT table?

3.insert records into the STUDENT table .

4.Write a query to add a new student record with the NAME 'SURYA' 
  and a FEE of 10000 into the STUDENT table.

5.Write a query to display all the records from the STUDENT table.

6.Write a query to add two columns ADDRESS, MAILID to

SQL>create table a1
    (
    sno number(10),
    sname varchar2(10)
    )
 
insert into a1 values(1,'surya');
insert into a1 values(2,'anushka');
commit;

1.What is DATABASE ?

 Database is a place where we can store structured collection
 of inter related data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.What is SQL ?

  SQL is structured query language.in sql we are writing queries.
with the help of queries we are communicating with the database.

  SQL language was introduced by E.F Codd. He is mathematician that's
why he was represented data in the format of matrix(rows and columns).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.What are DDL commands ? What is the purpose of create command ?

• DDL stands for Data Definition Language

• DDL command are used to define structure of the 
  table.

• The following are the DDL commands.

1)Create                   
2)Alter
3)Drop                     
4)Flashback                
5)Truncate
6)Purge
7)Rename (oracle 9i)

1)Create:- create command is used to create database objects like 
=========  tables, views, sequences, indexes,views, 
           procedures,functions.....etc 

NOTE:-By default DDL commands are auto committed.No need to give any commit
===== command explicitly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.What are DML commands

• DML stands for Data Manipulation Language.

• DML commands are used to manipulate data in a table.

• Simply in DML all operations we are performing on data.

• The following are the DML commands.

1.Insert
2.Update
3.Delete
4.Merge



1)insert: It is used to insert data into a table.
========

Method1:-
========
insert into tablename values(value1,value2,.......);


Method2:-(Using Substitutional operator)
========

    &------>Enter value for

Same like scanf function in C language.i.e is used to read
the values from the keyboard.

Here also '&' it is used to read the values from the keyboard.

syntax:-
=======
insert into tablename values(&col1,&col2.....);


Method3(Skipping columns):-in first 2 methods we need to provide values
=========================  for all the columns then only record is
                           inserted.

•For EG 10 columns are there i am interested to give values for only 3
 columns then we are using Skipping column method.

syntax:-
=======
insert into tablename(col1,col2....)values(value1,value2....);

NOTE:-DML commands are not auto commit commands.after inserting data use commit
====  command then only data is saved permanently in database.
